Huffman coding is a popular algorithm used for lossless data compression. It works by assigning variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters. This method ensures that the most commonly used characters take up less space, thereby reducing the overall size of the encoded data. Huffman coding is widely used in compression formats like JPEG, MP3, and ZIP files. By constructing a binary tree based on character frequencies, the algorithm efficiently compresses data while preserving all original information.
